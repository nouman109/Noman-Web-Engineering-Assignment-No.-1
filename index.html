<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> In this assignment, I created a portfolio website using HTML and CSS. On the Home Page, I wrote an introduction about my website. I utilized semantic tags, meta tags, favicon, and links to navigate different parts of the page. Additionally, I designed a header, footer, and navigation bar for other pages. On the My Hobbies page, I added ordered and unordered lists to showcase my hobbies. I also wrote about my favorite online and physical games. Furthermore, I created two colorful tables – one for my hobbies and another comparing games with my friend. The font and colors are consistent with the home page. On the My Favorite Media page, I divided the page into two parts using div and table elements. On one side, I featured my favorite social media posts, and on the other side, I included 5 YouTube video links. I also added some images from the internet and fixed pictures. Lastly, on the Contact Here page, I provided my name, designation, email, contact number, and office location with Google Map integration. I attempted to incorporate all the tags we learned in class and made my website colorful and unique with my own ideas.
